# Welcome to the underground

My name is Sulthan, sometimes Mika. I code sometimes but my preferred career is in RF. I'm pretty good at analog signal processing and 5G signals because of my bachelor's degree in telecommunications engineering. I'm looking for work in that field, mostly.

## My 'skills'
- **Python** is my main thing, I'm very familiar with it for general use, OOP, and data science
- **MATLAB** was my main focus during university, especially its signal processing and 5G toolboxes
- I have a bit of experience in antenna design using **CST Studio Suite**
- A bit of basic **HTML** and **CSS**, I'm kind of familiar with Angular and ThreeJS but not really

## My 'work'
- I'm not working on anything right now
